Evaluating WombatOAM
--------------------

Once you have successfully installed WombatOAM, you can try out WombatOAM by
opening a web browser and hitting http://localhost:8080. Enter
admin/admin in the appearing login window. To see what functionalities
are available, add WombatOAM itself to WombatOAM (node: wombat@127.0.0.1,
cookie: wombat).

WombatOAM features
------------------

WombatOAM provides the following features for Erlang and Elixir systems,
among others:

* It detects anomalies and early warning signs, and presents them in
  the form of alarms and notifications, so that the problems can be
  resolved before they cause service disruption.

* It provides live information about running systems, helps recover
  from outages for instance by forcing the GC to free up memory, or
  fix misconfiguration issues by changing configuration parameters.

* The monitoring functionality is divided into plugins, which run on
  the managed node and send information (metrics, notifications and
  alarms) to WombatOAM. A set of built-in plugins are shipped with
  WombatOAM, which can be turned on and off for each individual managed
  node.

* It ensures seamless integration with your existing OAM
  infrastructure by having existing integration with Graphite,
  DataDog, Graylog, Cacti, Nagios, Splunk, Logstash and PagerDuty
  with the capability of being integrated with any of the other OAM tools.

* It provides both a Web Dashboard and a REST interface: the former
  for interactive use, and the latter to support automation and
  integration.

* It visualizes the node topology and shows information about the
  nodes such as the application versions running on them.

* It collects more than a hundred built-in metrics about the Erlang
  VM, such as the amount of memory allocated for different purposes
  (atom memory, binary memory, etc), and the sum of the length of the
  message queues of all processes.

* It automatically collects all metrics from the folsom and exometer
  libraries, all logs from the SASL error_logger, lager and Elixir's
  Logger libraries, and all alarms from the SASL alarm_handler and elarm
  libraries.

* The web dashboard can plot both historic metrics and live metrics.
  Different metrics can be placed on the same graph.

* Besides numeric metrics such as counter and gauges, it supports
  meters, spirals and histograms.

* It can deploy Erlang nodes in the cloud or on specified machines.

--------------------------------------

* When using SSL, the minimum recommended Erlang version for running
  WombatOAM is R16B02. Without SSL the minimum required Erlang version is
  still R15B03, and WombatOAM can still manage nodes running on R14B04
  or later versions regardless of using SSL or not.

* Some browsers refuse to accept the self-signed certificates shipped
  with WombatOAM with certain Erlang/OTP versions. In that case you
  should either install proper certificates or switch to HTTP. See the
  "Configuration" section of the manual for the details.
